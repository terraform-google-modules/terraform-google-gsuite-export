# Terraform GSuite Export Module

The module will create a compute engine VM instance and set up a cronjob to export
GSuite Admin SDK data to **Stackdriver Logging** on a schedule.

Additional information on which APIs are supported is documented in the
[gsuite-exporter repository][gsuite-exporter-site].

## Usage

You can go to the [examples](./examples) folder to see all the use cases, however the usage of the module could be like this in your own `main.tf` file:

```hcl
module "gsuite-export" {
  source  = "terraform-google-modules/gsuite-export/google"
  version = "~> 0.1.0"

  admin_user          = "superadmin@domain.com
  service_account     = "svc@domain.com"
  project_id          = "my-project"
  api                 = "reports_v1"
  applications        = "login drive"
  frequency           = "*/10 * * * *"
}
```

Warning: Setting the `frequency` to a time inferior to 4 mn might cause the loss of records.

## Requirements

### Terraform plugins

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.12.x
- [terraform-provider-google](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-google) plugin v1.8.0

### APIs

For the GSuite Exporter to work, the following APIs must be enabled in the project:

- Logging API: `logging.googleapis.com`
- Identity and Access Management API: `iam.googleapis.com`
- Admin SDK API: `admin.googleapis.com`

### Service account

We need two Terraform service accounts for this module:

- **Terraform service account** (that will create the GSuite Export VM)
- **VM service account** (that will be used on the VM to pull logs from GSuite and write them to Stackdriver Logging)

The **Terraform service account** used to run this module must have the following IAM Roles:

- `Compute Instance Admin` on the project (to create the VM)
- `Service Account User` on the project (to associate the VM service account with the VM)
- `Project IAM Admin` on the project (to grant permissions to the VM service account)
- `Service Usage Admin` on the project (to allow service account to enable other APIs and services, e.g., Pub/Sub)

The **VM service account** passed to the module must have:

- GSuite domain-wide delegation enabled
- The following scopes in the [API client access page](https://admin.google.com/AdminHome?chromeless=1#OGX:ManageOauthClients)
  - <https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.reports.audit.readonly> (to read from the Reports API)
  - <https://www.googleapis.com/auth/iam> (to generate a super-admin token)

## Install

### Terraform

Be sure you have the correct Terraform version (0.10.x), you can choose the binary here:

- <https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/>

Then perform the following commands:

- `terraform init` to get the plugins
- `terraform plan` to see the infrastructure plan
- `terraform apply` to apply the infrastructure build
- `terraform destroy` to destroy the built infrastructure

#### Variables

Please refer the `variables.tf` file for the required and optional variables.

#### Outputs

Please refer the `outputs.tf` file for the outputs that you can get with the `terraform output` command

## File structure

The project has the following folders and files:

- /: root folder
- /examples: examples for using this module
- /scripts: Shell scripts for specific tasks on module
- /test: Folders with files for testing the module (see Testing section on this file)
- /main.tf: main file for this module, contains all the resources to create
- /variables.tf: all the variables for the module
- /output.tf: the outputs of the module
- /readme.MD: this file

## Testing

### Testing Requirements

- [bats](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats) 0.4.0

### Integration test

#### Terraform integration tests

The integration tests for this module are built with bats, basically the test checks the following:

- Perform `terraform init` command
- Perform `terraform get` command
- Perform `terraform plan` command and check that it'll create *n* resources, modify 0 resources and delete 0 resources
- Perform `terraform apply -auto-approve` command and check that it has created the *n* resources, modified 0 resources and deleted 0 resources
- Perform several `gcloud` commands and check the infrastructure is in the desired state
- Perform `terraform destroy -force` command and check that it has destroyed the *n* resources

You can use the following command to run the integration test in the folder */test/integration/gcloud-test*

  `. launch.sh`
